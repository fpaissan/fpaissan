### Hi there 👋

I'm an italian student that loves solving problems (or at least trying to 😝). I study physics and I do some research on ML related topics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on audio-visual signal processing for self-supervised learning and deep learning models for EEG processing;  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the intersection between ML and other fields;
- 📫 How to reach me: use LinkedIn, send me an e-mail;
