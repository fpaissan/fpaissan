### Hi there 👋

I'm an italian student that loves solving problems (or at least trying to 😝). I study physics and I do some research on ML related topics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - compressing NNs to fit on MCUs and embedded platforms;
  - self-supervised techniques to distill knowledge from big NNs;
  - ML-based pipelines for EEG processing;
  - ML techniques in physics.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the intersection between ML and other fields;
- 📫 How to reach me: everything is fine!
